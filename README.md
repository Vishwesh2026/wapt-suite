# WAPT Suite

A Comprehensive Web Application Penetration Testing Toolkit

---

## Overview

WAPT Suite is a full-featured toolkit designed to identify and evaluate security vulnerabilities in web applications. Developed as part of a Computer Science Engineering internship, the suite covers key threat vectors like **SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, leveraging both manual test scripts and industry-standard automated tools.

---

## Features

- **Automated and Manual Testing:** Supports both manual penetration testing scripts and automated scanners.
- **Vulnerability Modules:** Includes dedicated tools for SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF analysis.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Generates comprehensive and actionable vulnerability reports.
- **Integrated Workflow:** Seamlessly links front-end and back-end for a realistic pentesting environment.
- **API Security:** Contains endpoints and tests for RESTful interface vulnerabilities.
- **User Experience:** Uses semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and accessible UI components.
- **Project Management:** Employs tools like Trello and Jira for agile development and task tracking.
